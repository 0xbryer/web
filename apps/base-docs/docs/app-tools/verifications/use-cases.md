# Verification Use Cases

This document outlines common use cases for Base verifications and attestations.

---

## Overview

Base verifications and attestations enable developers to build trust and verify claims in their applications. Here are some key use cases:

### Identity Verification

- Verify user identity while preserving privacy
- Validate age requirements for regulated services
- Confirm professional credentials or licenses
- Authenticate organizational membership

### Transaction Verification

- Validate source of funds
- Verify transaction authenticity
- Confirm payment completion
- Authenticate asset ownership

### Access Control

- Manage role-based access
- Control feature availability
- Gate content access
- Restrict service usage

### Compliance

- Meet regulatory requirements
- Document policy adherence
- Track audit trails
- Maintain compliance records

### Community Trust

- Build reputation systems
- Verify social connections
- Validate community roles
- Authenticate achievements

## Implementation Examples

### Identity Verification Flow

1. User submits verification request
2. Required documents/credentials are collected
3. Verification provider validates submission
4. Attestation is issued on-chain
5. Application checks attestation for access

### Transaction Verification Flow

1. Transaction is initiated
2. Required proofs are gathered
3. Verification service validates proofs
4. Attestation confirms validity
5. Transaction proceeds based on attestation

## Best Practices

- Only request necessary verifications
- Clearly communicate verification requirements
- Provide smooth verification flows
- Handle verification failures gracefully
- Regularly audit verification usage
- Keep verification data up to date
- Follow data minimization principles

## Security Considerations

- Protect sensitive verification data
- Use secure verification providers
- Implement proper access controls
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Regular security audits
- Maintain verification logs
- Update security measures
