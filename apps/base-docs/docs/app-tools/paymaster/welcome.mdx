The Coinbase Paymaster API provides [ERC-4337](https://www.erc4337.io/) Account Abstraction endpoints to send transactions from smart wallets and sponsor gas for users.

Paymaster is [ERC-7677](https://www.erc7677.xyz/introduction) compliant and supports both [pm_getPaymasterStubData](https://www.erc7677.xyz/reference/paymasters/getPaymasterStubData) and [pm_getPaymasterData](https://www.erc7677.xyz/reference/paymasters/getPaymasterData).

The endpoint also provides access to our Bundler.

## Get started

1. [Create](https://coinbase.com/developer-platform) a new CDP account or [sign in](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com) to your existing account.
2. Create a new project.
3. Navigate to the Paymaster product where you'll see $100 in credits (and can get $500 more for adding a payment method).
4. Use the Playground to make a request and see the response.
5. Set your gas policy configurations. Allowlist at least one contract to protect against unintended sponsorship (disregard if allowlisting through a paymaster proxy).
6. Start sending UserOperations and creating gasless experiences for your users.
7. [Apply for additional gas credits](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yPnBFW0bVUNLUN_w3ctCqYM9sjdIQO3Typ53KXlsS5g/viewform?edit_requested=true&pli=1) as you scale.
