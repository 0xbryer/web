# Basenames FAQ

Welcome to the Basenames FAQ. Here you'll find answers to the most common questions about Basenames and how to use them effectively within the Base ecosystem.

## What are Basenames?

Basenames are human-readable names assigned to blockchain addresses, allowing users to easily identify and interact with each other without relying on complex wallet addresses. Think of Basenames as onchain identifiers that enhance user experience and accessibility.

## How do I register a Basename?

To register a Basename, visit our [Basenames Interface](https://base.org/names) and follow the registration process. Ensure you meet the prerequisites, such as having a registered wallet address and paying the necessary fees.

## What are the registration fees for Basenames?

Basename registration fees vary based on the length of the name:

| Letters | Annual Fee |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 3       | 0.1 ETH    |
| 4       | 0.01 ETH   |
| 5-9     | 0.001 ETH  |
| 10+     | 0.0001 ETH |

## Are there discounts available for Basename registration?

## How can I update my Basename profile?

You can update your Basename profile through the [Basenames Interface](https://base.org/names). This includes adding or modifying metadata like social links, descriptions, and more.

## Can I transfer my Basename to another address?
