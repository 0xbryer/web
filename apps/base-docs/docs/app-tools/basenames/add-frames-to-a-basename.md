# Add Frames to a Basename

Enhance your Basename profile with Farcaster Frames to create more engaging and interactive experiences for your visitors. Frames allow you to embed rich content directly onto your Basename profile, enabling a dynamic representation of your onchain identity.

## Overview

Frames are interactive elements that can be added to your Basename profile, allowing you to showcase content such as images, videos, links, and more. By incorporating Frames, you can provide a more personalized and visually appealing profile for users interacting with your Basename.

## Prerequisites

Before adding Frames to your Basename, ensure you have the following:

- A registered Basename
- Basic understanding of Farcaster Frames
- A development environment set up with Node.js

1. **Access the Basenames Interface:**

   Navigate to the [Basenames Interface](https://base.org/names) and log in with your wallet.

2. **Edit Your Basename Profile:**

   Select the Basename you wish to enhance and click on the "Edit Profile" button.

3. **Add a New Frame:**

   - Click on "Add Frame."
   - Choose the type of content you want to embed (e.g., Image, Video, Link).
   - Enter the necessary details for the frame, such as the URL or upload the media file.

4. **Customize the Frame:**

   Adjust the size, position, and other visual aspects of the Frame to fit your profile's design aesthetic.
